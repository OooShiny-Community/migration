# Oooshiny Google Groups Migration

Moving on from Google Groups to a self hosted, user-maintained platform.

Required features:

 - Support for a traditional email-based list-serve
 - Memberâ€™s can invite other members
 - Avoiding any third-party solutions that eventually become disrupted and we have to move again.

See main [#1 Discourse Installation Progress](https://github.com/OooShiny-Community/migration/issues/1) for more details and view [Log](https://github.com/OooShiny-Community/migration/blob/master/LOG.md) and [Issues](https://github.com/OooShiny-Community/migration/issues) to track progress.
